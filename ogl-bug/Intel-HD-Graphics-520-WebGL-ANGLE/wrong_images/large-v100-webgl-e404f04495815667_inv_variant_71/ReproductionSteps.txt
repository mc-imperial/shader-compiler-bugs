Steps to Reproduce:
-------------------------------
1. Open the Chrome browser
2. Navigate to http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mc-imperial/shader-compiler-bugs/blob/master/utils/webgl/webgl_viewer.html
3. Paste the contents of original.frag into the text box
4. Click "Execute"; the rendered image is the expected image for this shader, and should look like original.png
5. Paste the contents of variant.frag into the text box
6. Click "Execute"; you should find that the rendered image is significantly different from the expected image rendered previously

Expected Results:
-------------------------------
Both shaders should render an image that looks like original.png.  This is because the only difference between the .frag files is:

- There is a "discard" statement after a "break" statement in
  variant.frag; because the "discard" statement is unreachable code,
  this should have no effect on computation.

Actual Results:
-------------------------------
The shaders render significantly different images, which they should not.

Additional Information:
