Steps to Reproduce:
-------------------------------

1. Obtain the latest release of get-image, a simple tool that creates
   a .png image from a fragment shader (alternatively, use some other
   method observing the effect of a fragment shader)

2. From a command prompt, execute:

   C:\path\to\get_image\bin\Windows\get_image.exe original.frag

   This will create output.png, which should look like original.png

3. From a command prompt, execute:

   C:\path\to\get_image\bin\Windows\get_image.exe variant.frag

   This will create output.png, which should look like variant.png

Expected Results:
-------------------------------
Both shaders should render an image that looks like original.png.  This is because the only difference between the .frag files is:

- There is an expression, 1.0, right after the return statement in
  "color_at".  This expression is unreachable and side-effect free, so
  should not impact on the results of shader execution.


Actual Results:
-------------------------------
The shaders render completely different images, which they should not.

Additional Information:
